			<div class="exp-det">
				<div class="exp-li">Problem</div>
				<div class="exp-lt">
					Urban transit systems are structurally complex and sometime poorly represented in consumer applications, making it difficult to compute reliable routes across multi-modal transport networks with inconsistent public data.
				</div>
				<div class="exp-li">Role</div>
				<div class="exp-lt">
					Designed and implemented a routing engine for urban transport graphs, supporting multiple cities with differing network structures and data formats.
					Built data ingestion pipelines to normalize heterogeneous transit datasets and enable consistent path computation.
					Delivered a cross-platform interface (web/mobile) exposing optimized routes based on time and transfer constraints.
